@*Intro. This program is part of a series of ``SAT-solvers'' that I'm putting
together for my own education as I prepare to write Section 7.2.2.2 of
{\sl The Art of Computer Programming}. My intent is to have a variety of
compatible programs on which I can run experiments to learn how different
approaches work in practice.

This time I'm implementing the algorithm that physicists have christened
``Survey Propagation.'' It's a development of a message-passing idea
called ``Belief Propagation,'' which in turn extends ``Warning Propagation.''
[See Braunstein, M\'ezard, and Zecchina,
 {\sl Random Structures \char`\& Algorithms\/
\bf27} (2005), 201--226.] And I'm also implementing an extended, improved
algorithm that incorporates ``reinforcement'' [see Chavas, Furtlehner,
M\'ezard, and Zecchina, {\sl Journal of Statistical Mechanics\/}
(November 2005), P11016, 25~pages]. While writing this code I was greatly
helped by studying an implementation prepared by Carlo Baldassi in March 2012.

@ If you have already read {\mc SAT8}, or any other program of this
series, you might as well skip now past the rest of this introduction,
and past the code for the
``I/O wrapper'' that is presented in the next dozen or so
sections, because you've seen it before. (Except that there are several
new command-line options, and the output is a reduced set of clauses
rather than a solution.)

The input appears on |stdin| as a series of lines, with one clause per line.
Each clause is a sequence of literals separated by spaces. Each literal is
a sequence of one to eight ASCII characters between \.{!} and \.{\}},
inclusive, not beginning with \.{\~},
optionally preceded by \.{\~} (which makes the literal ``negative'').
For example, Rivest's famous clauses on four variables,
found in 6.5--(13) and 7.1.1--(32) of {\sl TAOCP}, can be represented by the
following eight lines of input: 
$$\chardef~=`\~
\vcenter{\halign{\tt#\cr
x2 x3 ~x4\cr
x1 x3 x4\cr
~x1 x2 x4\cr
~x1 ~x2 x3\cr
~x2 ~x3 x4\cr
~x1 ~x3 ~x4\cr
x1 ~x2 ~x4\cr
x1 x2 ~x3\cr}}$$
Input lines that begin with \.{\~\ } are ignored (treated as comments).
The output will be `\.{\~\~?}' if the algorithm could not
find a way to satisfy the input clauses.
Otherwise it will be a {\it partial\/} solution: a
list of noncontradictory literals that cover some but maybe not all of the
clauses, separated by spaces. (``Noncontradictory'' means that we don't
have both a literal and its negation.) The residual problem, which must
be satisfied if the partial assignment turns out to be valid, is
written to an auxiliary file. (The partial assignment might be faulty;
the algorithm has pretty good heuristics, but there are no guarantees.)

The input above would, for example, probably
yield `\.{\~\~?}'. But if the final clause were omitted, the output might be
`\.{\~x1} \.{\~x2}', leaving a residual problem with the two clauses
`\.{x3} \.{\~x4}' and `\.{x3} \.{x4}'.
Or it might be `\.{\~x3}', leaving the (unsatisfiable) residual
problem `\.{x2} \.{\~x4}', `\.{x1} \.{x4}', `\.{\~x1} \.{x2}, \.{x4}',
`\.{\~x1} \.{\~x2}', `\.{x1} \.{\~x2} \.{\~x4}'.

The running time in ``mems'' is also reported, together with the approximate
number of bytes needed for data storage. One ``mem'' essentially means a
memory access to a 64-bit word.
(These totals don't include the time or space needed to parse the
input or to format the output.)

@*The I/O wrapper. The following routines read the input and absorb it into
temporary data areas from which all of the ``real'' data structures
can readily be initialized. My intent is to incorporate these routines in all
of the SAT-solvers in this series. Therefore I've tried to make the code
short and simple, yet versatile enough so that almost no restrictions are
placed on the sizes of problems that can be handled. These routines are
supposed to work properly unless there are more than
$2^{32}-1=4$,294,967,295 occurrences of literals in clauses,
or more than $2^{31}-1=2$,147,483,647 variables or clauses.

In these temporary tables, each variable is represented by four things:
its unique name; its serial number; the clause number (if any) in which it has
most recently appeared; and a pointer to the previous variable (if any)
with the same hash address. Several variables at a time
are represented sequentially in small chunks of memory called ``vchunks,''
which are allocated as needed (and freed later).

@d vars_per_vchunk 341 /* preferably $(2^k-1)/3$ for some $k$ */

@<Type...@>=
typedef union {
  char ch8[8];
  uint u2[2];
  long long lng;
} octa;
typedef struct tmp_var_struct {
  octa name; /* the name (one to seven ASCII characters) */
  uint serial; /* 0 for the first variable, 1 for the second, etc. */
  int stamp; /* |m| if positively in clause |m|; |-m| if negatively there */
  struct tmp_var_struct *next; /* pointer for hash list */
} tmp_var;
@#
typedef struct vchunk_struct {
  struct vchunk_struct *prev; /* previous chunk allocated (if any) */
  tmp_var var[vars_per_vchunk];
} vchunk;

@ Each clause in the temporary tables is represented by a sequence of
one or more pointers to the |tmp_var| nodes of the literals involved.
A negated literal is indicated by adding~1 to such a pointer.
The first literal of a clause is indicated by adding~2.
Several of these pointers are represented sequentially in chunks
of memory, which are allocated as needed and freed later.

@ The hash address of each variable name has $h$ bits, where $h$ is the
value of the adjustable parameter |hbits|.
Thus the average number of variables per hash list is $n/2^h$ when there
are $n$ different variables. A warning is printed if this average number
exceeds 10. (For example, if $h$ has its default value, 8, the program will
suggest that you might want to increase $h$ if your input has 2560
different variables or more.)

All the hashing takes place at the very beginning,
and the hash tables are actually recycled before any SAT-solving takes place;
therefore the setting of this parameter is by no means crucial. But I didn't
want to bother with fancy coding that would determine $h$ automatically.

@*SAT solving, version 9. Survey Propagation is slightly similar to WalkSAT,
but it's really a new kettle of fish. Clauses pass messages to each of
their literals, representing locally known information about the other
literals in the clause. Literals pass messages to each of the clauses that they
or their complement are in, representing locally known information about
the other clauses to which they belong. When we find a variable with a
strong tendency to be true or false, we fix its value and reduce to a
smaller system. Local information continues to propagate until we get
some sort of convergence.

The clause-to-literal messages are called $\eta$'s. If $c$ is a clause
and $l$ is a literal, $\eta_{c\to l}$ is a fraction between 0 and~1
that is {\it large\/} if $c$ urgently needs $l$ to be true, otherwise
it's small.

The literal-to-clause messages are called $\pi$'s. They too are fractions
between 0 and~1, but they're sort of dual because they represent
flexibility: The value of $\pi_{l\to c}$ is {\it small\/} when
clauses other than~$c$ badly want $l$ to be true.

An ``external force field'' that gently nudges literal $l$ towards a
particular value, with urgency $\eta_l$, is also present. This
force-of-reinforcement tends to improve decision-making, because it encourages
the algorithm to decide between competing tendencies.

Internally we maintain a single value $\pi_l$ for each literal, namely
$1-\eta_l$ times the product of $1-\eta_{c\to l}$ over all clauses~$c$
that contain~$l$.
The message $\pi_{l\to c}$ is then simply $\pi_l$ when $l\notin c$;
and it's $\pi_l/(1-\eta_{c\to l})$ when $l\in c$.
We use a special data structure to
count the factors of this product that happen to be zero (within
floating-point precision), so that division by zero isn't a problem.

@ The data structures are analogous to those of previous programs in this
series. There are three main arrays, |cmem|, |lmem|, and |mem|. Structured
|clause| nodes appear in |cmem|, and structured |literal| nodes
appear in |lmem|. Each clause points to a sequential list of literals and
$\eta$'s in~|mem|; each literal points to a linked list of clause slots
in~|mem|, showing where that literal occurs in the problem. The literal
nodes in |lmem| also hold $\eta_l$ and $\pi_l$.

As in most previous programs of this series, the literals $x$ and $\bar x$
are represented internally by $2k$ and $2k+1$ when $x$ is variable number~$k$.

The symbolic names of variables are kept separately in an array called |nmem|.

@ Either $\eta_l$ or $\eta_{\bar l}$ is zero; the other is
$(1-|factor|)$ times $\vert p-q\vert$, where $p$ and $q$ are the normalized
forces that favor $l$ and $\bar l$.

In this loop |l=2k|, when we process variable~$k$.
The |rating| field
of |l| is set to $+1$, $0$, or $-1$ if we currently rate the variable's
value as $1$, $*$, or $0$.

This rating ``field'' is based on what the physicists also call a ``field,''
but in a different context: They consider that literal~|l| tends to be 
$(1,0,*)$ with probabilities that are respectively proportional to
$(\pi_{\bar l}(1{-}\pi_l),\allowbreak\,\pi_l(1{-}\pi_{\bar l}),
\allowbreak\,\pi_{\bar l}\pi_l)$.
These probabilities can be normalized so that they are $(p,q,r)$ with
$p+q+r=1$. The rating is 0 if and only if $r\ge\max\{p,q\}$; otherwise it's
$+1$ when $p>q$, or $-1$ when $p<q$. The condition $r\ge\max\{p,q\}$ turns out
to be equivalent to saying that $\pi_l$ and $\pi_{\bar l}$ are
both $\ge0.5$. Later we will use $\vert p-q\vert$ to decide the
``bias'' of a literal.

@ The difference $b=100\,\vert p-q\vert$ in the field of variable~$v$
represents $v$'s percentage bias
towards a non-$*$ value. All variables for which $b$ is greater than
or equal to the |confidence| parameter are placed into bucket~|b|.
Then we go through buckets 100, 99, etc., fixing those variables.
We also make a ``|unit|'' bucket for literals that appear in unit
clauses after reduction.

Links within the bucket lists are odd numbers, terminated by~2; they
appear in the |rating| fields of |lmem[1]|, |lmem[3]|, etc.

It's probably unwise for the user to make |confidence<50|, because
the pseudo-satisfiability test rates a variable of field $(.5,0,.5)$
as a~`$*$'. But we haven't ruled that out; after all, this program
is just experimental, and it's sometimes interesting to explore the
consequences of unwise decisions. Therefore we recompute the
|rating| fields in |lmem[0]|, |lmem[2]|, etc., so that they
merely reflect the sign of $p-q$.
