@*Introduction. I'm trying to calculate a few billion Ulam numbers.
This sequence 
$$(U_1,U_2,\ldots{})=(1,2,3,4,6,8,11,13,16,18,
                       26,28,36,38,47,48,53,57,62,69,\ldots{})$$
is defined by setting $U_1=1$, $U_2=2$, and thereafter letting
$U_{n+1}$ be the smallest number greater than $U_n$ that can be
written $U_j+U_k$ for exactly one pair $(j,k)$ with $1\le j<k\le n$.
(Such a number must exist; otherwise the pair $(j,k)=(n-1,n)$ would
qualify and lead to a contradiction.)

The related sequence
$$(1, 2, 23, 25, 33, 35, 43, 45, 67, 92, 94, 96, 111, 121, 136,\ldots{})$$
of ``Ulam misses'' contains all numbers that cannot be
expressed as the sum of two distinct Ulams.

This program is based on some beautiful ideas due to Philip E. Gibbs,
whose Java code in 2015 was first to beat the billion-number barrier.
It runs much, much faster than the bitwise-oriented program {\mc ULAM} 
that I wrote ten years ago. And it has some interesting touches that
taught me some lessons, which I'm keen to pass on to others.

Ulam mentioned this sequence in {\sl SIAM Review\/ \bf6} (1964), 348,
as part of a more general discussion. Its properties have baffled number
theorists for many years; but new insights are beginning to change the picture:
Stefan Steinerberger discovered empirically that $U_n/\lambda\mod1$ almost
always lies in the interval $\bigl[{1\over3}.\,.{2\over3}]$, where
$\lambda\approx2.443443$ [``A hidden signal in the Ulam sequence,''
Report DCS/TR-1508 (Yale University, 2015)].
Then Gibbs [``An efficient method for computing Ulam numbers,''
viXra:1508.0085 (2015)] exploited that property in nontrivial ways,
finding that roughly $O(N)$ time and $O(N)$ space suffice to compute
the first $N$ terms. He subsequently discovered how to significantly
decrease the coefficients of~$N$ in the time and space requirements; and when I
asked him how he did it, he kindly sent me a copy of his program.
@^Ulam, Stanis{\l}aw Marcin@>
@^Steinerberger, Stefan@>
@^Gibbs, Philip Edward@>

Of course I couldn't resist translating it from Java into \.{CWEB},
because that's what I do for a living. So this is the result.

@ This program has lots of tunable parameters, and it should prove
to be interesting to see how they affect the performance. Of course
the main parameter is $N$, the desired number of outputs. Other options
are preceded on the command line by a letter; for example,
`\.{v5}' sets the verboseness parameter to~5.

Each parameter will
be explained later, but it's convenient to summarize the option letters here:
\smallskip
\item{$\bullet$}
`\.v$\langle\,$integer$\,\rangle$' to enable various binary-coded
levels of verbose output on |stderr| (default=1).
\item{$\bullet$}
`\.p$\langle\,$positive integer$\,\rangle$' to specify the numerator
of a rational approximation to~$\lambda$ (default=120500181).
\item{$\bullet$}
`\.q$\langle\,$positive integer$\,\rangle$' to specify the denominator
of a rational approximation to~$\lambda$ (default=49315733). The program
assumes that $p$ and $q$ are less than $2^{32}$, and that $2<p/q\le3$.
\item{$\bullet$}
`\.m$\langle\,$positive integer$\,\rangle$' to specify the spacing
of outputs; every $m$th Ulam number will be written to standard output.
(The default is $m=1000000$; \.{m0} will report only $U_N$.)
\item{$\bullet$}
`\.g$\langle\,$positive integer$\,\rangle$' to specify the largest
gap for which statistics are kept (default=2000).
\item{$\bullet$}
`\.o$\langle\,$positive integer$\,\rangle$' to specify the space
allocated for ``outliers'' and ``near-outliers'' (default=1000000).
\item{$\bullet$}
`\.i$\langle\,$positive integer$\,\rangle$' to specify the size of the
indexes to those lists (default=100000).
\item{$\bullet$}
`\.T$\langle\,$positive real$\,\rangle$' to specify the threshold
in the definition of `near outlier' (default=100).
\item{$\bullet$}
`\.b$\langle\,$positive integer$\,\rangle$' to specify the number
of bits of the |is_um| table that are stored in a single byte (default=18).
(That default is optimum: \.{b19} turns out to be too high, if $N>2198412$.)
\item{$\bullet$}
`\.B$\langle\,$positive integer$\,\rangle$' to specify the number
of initial |is_ulam| entries that are encoded with one bit per byte
(default=18000). This value should be a multiple of the \.b option,
and at least~3.
\item{$\bullet$}
`\.w$\langle\,$positive integer$\,\rangle$' to specify the window size
for remembering recently computed Ulam numbers (default=1000000).
The window size must be at least~3.
\item{$\bullet$}
`\.M$\langle\,$filename$\,\rangle$' to produce \MP\ illustrations
showing the distributions of Ulam numbers and Ulam misses, modulo~$\lambda$.

@* The ideas behind the algorithm.
Gibbs's method is based on the amazing fact that almost all of the
values $(U_n/\lambda)\mod 1$ lie between 1/3 and 2/3.
Indeed, here's one of the pictures produced by the \MP\ option of this
program, showing the distribution of those residues for $1\le n\le N=1000000$:
$$ \vcenter{\epsfbox{ulam-gibbs.1}}$$
The colors range from green for small~$n$ to red for $n$ near~$N$, so we
can see the way things ``settle down'' to a fairly stable
distribution as $n$ grows.

Let $U$ be an integer, and let $\rho=(U/\lambda)\mod1$ be its associated
residue. We might as well assume that the quasi-period length $\lambda$ 
is irrational, since ``God wouldn't have wanted a rational number that
occurs in problems like this to have a really big denominator.''
Under that assumption, $\rho$ is never a rational number, and
$\rho\ne\rho'$ when $U\ne U'$. (Of course, we will actually do our
calculations using a rational approximation to~$\lambda$; hence we'll
run into many cases where $\rho=\rho'$.)

Steinerberger found empirically
in 2015 that $\rho_n$ lies between 1/4 and 3/4 for all known values
of $U_n$, except for four cases:
$U_2=2$, $\rho_2\approx.82$;
$U_3=3$, $\rho_2\approx.23$;
$U_{15}=47$, $\rho_{15}\approx.23$;
$U_{20}=69$, $\rho_{20}\approx.24$.
The reasons for this are unclear, but the facts speak for themselves.

Gibbs went further and defined $U$ to be an `outlier' if $\rho<1/3$
or $\rho>2/3$. He observed that there must be infinitely many outliers,
because the sum of two `inliers' cannot be an `inlier'. But he
conjectured that, for any $\epsilon>0$, there are only finitely many~$n$
with $\rho_n<1/3-\epsilon$ or $\rho_n>2/3+\epsilon$.
And he observed that in the vast majority of known cases, the unique
representation $U_n=U_i+U_j$ has the property that
either $U_i$ or $U_j$ is an outlier.

Let's pursue this further. If $U=U'+U''$, then we have either
$\rho=\rho'+\rho''$ or $\rho=\rho'+\rho''-1$. The second case can
be written $\bar\rho=\bar\rho'+\bar\rho''$, where $\bar\rho=1-\rho$.

If $\rho<1/4$ or $\rho>3/4$, it turns out that we can almost always find
two completely different representations of $U$ as a sum of two Ulam
numbers, using a short brute-force search. 

On the other hand, if $1/4<\rho<3/4$,
we can usually decide whether $U$ is a sum of Ulam numbers $U'+U''$
by looking at relatively few cases where $\rho=\rho'+\rho''$
and $\rho'<\rho''$ or $\bar\rho=\bar\rho'+\bar\rho''$ and
$\bar\rho'<\bar\rho''$. Gibbs discovered empirically that it suffices to
try cases where $U'$ is either an outlier
or a `near outlier', where the latter is defined by the condition
$$
\hbox{$\rho'<1/2$ and $(\rho'-1/3)\sqrt{U'}\le\theta$}\qquad\hbox{or}\qquad
\hbox{$\bar\rho'<1/2$ and $(\bar\rho'-1/3)\sqrt{U'}\le\theta$}$$
and $\theta$ is the thresh parameter |thresh| in our program.
If $U'$ is large and $\rho'>1/3$, we won't need to consider $U'$ unless
$\rho'$ is {\it extremely\/} close to~1/3.

Consequently we needn't remember detailed information about too many
of the Ulam numbers already computed. The brute-force search requires
only a reasonably small window; the other searches require only
a dictionary of outliers and near-outliers~$U'$, sorted by $\rho'$.

@ Besides those relatively short tables, we also need a way to
determine whether or not a given number $u\le U_N$ is an Ulam number.
It's known empirically that $U_N\approx 13.5178N$, with minor
fluctuations; thus we can safely assume that $U_N<14N$, and
a table of $14N$ bits will suffice.

Still, $14N$ bits is $1.75N$ bytes, which can be substantial
when $N$ is many billions. Gibbs was working with just 16 gigabytes
of memory, and necessity was the mother of invention:
He devised a way to reduce this storage requirement
to only $.778N$ bytes, by packing 18 bits into a single byte. This reduction
turned out to be possible, and even convenient,
because the bit patterns have somewhat low entropy.
In fact, at most 256 different patterns actually occur in the |is_ulam| table
for 18 consecutive values of~$n$, provided that $n$ is large enough
to make the quasi-periodic system relatively stable.

@ Gibbs's early program used floating-point arithmetic to compute
the residues~$\rho$. But that led to tricky cases and subtle problems.
Then he realized that rational approximations to $\lambda$ are able to avoid
rounding errors, and his program became simpler besides.

He found a good approximation to $\lambda$ empirically, by adjusting it
until the number of ``low'' outliers with $\rho<1/3$ was essentially equal to
the number of ``high'' outliers with $\rho>2/3$. This value was
$$\lambda\;\approx\;2.443442967784743,$$
with the next digits as yet undetermined. Consequently the
regular continued fraction is
$$\lambda\;=\;
  2+\bslash 2,3,1,11,1,1,4,1,1,7,1,2,1,1,2,2,1,3,1,2,\ldots{}\bslash,$$
using the notation of {\sl Seminumerical Algorithms}, \S4.5.3.
Truncating this continued fraction gives good rational approximations
to~$\lambda$; in fact they're the ``best possible'' such approximations,
according to the theorem of Lagrange in exercise 4.5.3--42:
$$2;\quad
{5\over2};\quad
{17\over7};\quad
{22\over9};\quad
{259\over106};\quad
{281\over115};\quad
{540\over221};\quad
{2441\over999};\quad
\ldots;\quad
{35876494\over14682763};\quad
{84623687\over34632970}\hbox{ or }
{120500181\over49315733}.$$
The latter two seem to bracket the true value of $\lambda$. The final one
is the current default, but the other one will probably give equally good
results.

When we use the approximation $\lambda=p/q$, the formula $\rho
=U/\lambda\mod1$ becomes transformed:
$$r\;=\;qU\mod p.$$
The residue is now an {\it integer\/} called $r$, and it lies between 0 and
$p-1$, instead of being a fraction $\rho$ between 0 and~1.
(Program variables |lamp| and |lamq| correspond to $p$ and $q$.)

@ These ideas may be easiest to absorb if we work first with small
numbers. Suppose $p=22$ and $q=9$; this gives a fairly decent
approximation $2.4444\ldots\,$ to $\lambda$. The first 100 values
of $r_n=9U_n\mod22$ turn out to be nicely concentrated:

The outliers for $\lambda=540/221$ have $r<180$ or $r\ge360$.
Note that $U_{100}=690$. 

@*The compression scheme.
Let's build up some confidence by beginning to write low-level
routines for the |is_ulam| table. That table consists of two parts:
For $0\le n<|uncompressed_bytes|$, we simply have |is_ulam[n]=1|
when |n| is an Ulam number, |is_ulam[n]=0| when it isn't.
But for |n>=uncompressed_bytes|, a compressed table called
|is_um| contains the necessary information in a lightly encoded form.

Namely, let |b=bits_per_compressed_byte| be the \.b option on the
command line (normally~18). Then |is_um[n/b]| will be a byte~|t|
such that |is_ulam[n]| appears as bit $n\mod b$ of~|code[t]|.
This convention applies for $|uncompressed_bytes|\le n<|cur_slot|$,
where |cur_slot| is $b\times\lfloor u/b\rfloor$ and |u| is the number
that we're currently examining. Finally, the |is_ulam| bits for
|b| numbers beginning at |cur_slot| are maintained as the
|b|-bit number |cur_code|.

Of course we must give up if more than 256 different codewords are needed.
Auxiliary tables are maintained to provide further information:
|code_use[t]| records the number of times we've used |code[t]|;
|code_example[t]| records the smallest |cur_slot| that needed |code[t]|.
Such information is maintained behind the scenes, although I could
have omitted |code_use| and |code_example| if I were going all out for
speed. Their values are always calculated, but
reported only if |show_compression_stats| is selected.

The |is_um| table accounts for most of the memory required by
this program. It occupies $\lceil 14|maxn|/b\rceil$ bytes,
because $14|maxn|$ is an upper bound on the numbers~|u| that
we need to consider. (Notice that the first |uncompressed_bytes/b|
of |is_um| are never used.
That's a small price to pay for ease of programming.)

The number of memory bytes used, kept in |bytes|, accounts only
for necessary tables like |is_ulam|, |is_um|, and |code|. It doesn't
mention the memory that is devoted to diagnostic data, in arrays
such as |code_use| or |code_example|. Any memory allocated to
the program itself, and to its atomic global variables,
is also blithely ignored.

I also ignore the cost of system calls to |malloc| and |calloc|;
the memory accesses that they make, while this program is
launching itself, are not reported in |mems|.

@*Remembering key Ulam numbers.
Continuing at the low level, let's implement the other data structures
that record important facts about the Ulam numbers we've seen.

First there's the |window| table, which is easy: It is simply a
cyclic buffer for the most recent |window_size| Ulam numbers discovered.

@<Allocate the arrays@>=
window=(ullng*)malloc(window_size*sizeof(ullng));
if (!window) alloc_quit("window",window_size);
bytes+=window_size*sizeof(ullng);

@ We'll maintain the value |nw=n mod window_size|.

@<Place |u| into the |window|@>=
o,window[nw]=u;

@ The other structures, which remember the outliers and near-outliers
that have been discovered so far, are more interesting. We need to
process those numbers in order of their residues.

Gibbs introduced a special data structure for them, using an index into
a doubly linked list. A similar but simpler structure is implemented here,
with {\it two\/} indexes into two {\it singly\/} linked lists.

The number of outliers and near-outliers is, fortunately, small enough
that we needn't be too fussy about saving memory space when we store them.
Each node of a search list has three fields: Two for the number itself
and its residue; one for a link to the successor node.

@<Type definitions@>=
typedef struct {
  ullng u; /* an Ulam number */
  int r; /* its residue */
  int next; /* pointer to the next node in order of |r| */
} node;

@ There are two search lists: One for the outliers and near-outliers
with small residues, and one for the outliers and near-outliers with
large residues. In the latter we store the complementary residue
$\bar r=p-r$ instead of~|r| itself as the search key, because we'll be
traversing each list in order of increasing keys.

Nodes with the same |r| key are ordered by their |u| values.

All nodes of these lists appear in the |nmem| array, with their list heads
|lo_out| and |hi_out| in positions 0 and~1.

@d bar(r) (lamp-(r))
@d lo_out 0
@d hi_out 1

@<Glob...@>=
ullng *window; /* a cyclic buffer that remembers recent Ulam numbers */
int nw; /* |n mod window_size| */
node *nmem; /* the nodes of binary search trees */
int node_ptr=2; /* this many nodes are in use */
uint *inx[2]; /* indexes to the lists */
uint avail; /* head of the stack of available nodes */
stat ins_stats[4]; /* statistics for insertion into the four trees */

@ @<Allocate the arrays@>=
nmem=(node*)malloc((2+outliers)*sizeof(node));
if (!nmem) alloc_quit("nmem",outliers);
bytes+=(2+outliers)*sizeof(node);
inx[0]=(uint*)malloc((isize/2+1)*sizeof(uint));
if (!inx[0]) alloc_quit("inx[0]",outliers);
inx[1]=(uint*)malloc((isize/2+1)*sizeof(uint));
if (!inx[1]) alloc_quit("inx[1]",outliers);
bytes+=(isize+2)*sizeof(uint);

@ Lists are terminated either by the |null| link~0 or by the |danger| link~1
(which will be discussed below).
Initially the lists are empty, and all index entries point to the list head,
whose |r|~field is~0.

@d null 0 /* end of list */
@d danger 1 /* end of list that has been cut off */

@<Init...@>=
oo,nmem[lo_out].next=null,nmem[lo_out].r=0;
oo,nmem[hi_out].next=null,nmem[hi_out].r=0;
for (i=0;i<=isize/2;i++) oo,inx[0][i]=lo_out,inx[1][i]=hi_out;
avail=0;

@ Here's now we insert new nodes into such a list. The key invariant is that,
if key~|r| causes us to start at index entry~|j|, then every index
$j'>j$ will be examined only for keys that are strictly greater than~|r|.
Therefore it is legal for them to point to the newly inserted node.

This subroutine is called only when |u| is larger than any of the |u|~fields
already in the list.

@d insert(head,u,r) if (!ins(head,u,r)) {
       fprintf(stderr,"Oh oh, there's outlier overflow (size="O"d)!\n",
                              outliers);

  else return 0; /* there's no more room */
  oo,nmem[z].u=u,nmem[z].r=r;
  if (vbose&show_outlier_details)
    fprintf(stderr," (remembering "O"soutlier "O"lld, "O"s="O"d)\n",
           r>lamp/3?"near-":"",u,head==hi_out?"rbar":"r",r);
  j=((ullng)r*isize)/lamp;
  o,x=inx[head][j];
  for (o,y=nmem[x].next,count=1;

  return 1;
}  

@ We will also sometimes discard a near-outlier, if it becomes more ``in''
than a discarded inlier. This is where |danger| creeps in to the data.

Again, this subroutine is called only when |u| is larger than any of the
|u|~fields already in the list.

We will never insert items with residue |>=r| again, so there's no need
to update the index.

@ Our assumption that $\lfloor(p-1)/q\rfloor=2$ ensures that
$U_1=1$ is a low near-outlier and that

they are Ulam misses as well as Ulam numbers.

@*The brute-force tests.
Now we're ready to attack the main problem, which is to decide if
the current number |u| is an Ulam number, an Ulam miss, or neither.
Gibbs's strategy, as stated above, is to do this in two different
ways, depending on |u|'s residue~|r|. Half of the time,
when |r<=lamp/4| or |lamp-r<=lamp/4|, a brute-force search using the
previously windowed results will suffice.

64 bits when |u| is sufficiently large.

@<Compute |u|'s residue, |r|@>=
r=u mod lamp;
r=(lamq*(ullng)r) mod lamp;

@ The brute-force search uses the simple idea that we can have
$u=u'+u''$ with $u'>u''$ only if $u'>u/2$. So we look at the
previously computed numbers $u'=U_n$, $U_{n-1}$, \dots, until
we've either found two cases with $u-u'$ an Ulam number,
or $u'$ is too small, or we run out of suitable numbers in the window.

@ Histograms for the Ulam numbers and Ulam misses are kept in

@*Absorbing a new Ulam number.

if (r<=lamp/3) @<Record |u| as a low outlier@>@;
else if (r<=lamp/2) @<If |u| is a low near-outlier, record it@>@;
else if (bar(r)<=lamp/3) @<Record |u| as a high outlier@>@;
else @<If |u| is a high near-outlier, record it@>;

@ @<Record |u| as a low outlier@>=
{
  if (r<=lowest_outlier) {
    lowest_outlier=r;
    if (vbose&show_record_outliers)
      fprintf(stderr," (record low outlier r="O"d, u="O"lld)\n",r,u);
  }
  insert(lo_out,u,r);
}

@ @<Record |u| as a high outlier@>=
{
  if (r>=highest_outlier) {
    highest_outlier=r;
    if (vbose&show_record_outliers)
      fprintf(stderr," (record high outlier r="O"d, u="O"lld\n",r,u);
  }
  insert(hi_out,u,bar(r));
}

@ Gibbs's heuristic ``inness'' score, $(\rho-{1\over3})\sqrt{u}$
when $\rho\le{1\over2}$, must be $T$ or less if |u| is to be
remembered as a low near-outlier. We know that $r\ge(p+1)/3$ at
this point; hence $T/(\rho-1/3)=3Tp/(3r-p)\le 3Tp$.

When we do {\it not\/} store |u|, we must ensure that a mistake hasn't
been made. So we will flag an error if any future search for
a near-outlying ``anchor point'' would have encountered a number
whose residue is greater than~|r|, or equal to~|r| with an 
associated value greater than~|u|. (Because in such a case,
the algorithm should have really encountered the number we're dropping.)

Think about this carefully, because it's the most subtle point of the program!

|danger| when we encounter it.
